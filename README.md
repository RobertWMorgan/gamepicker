# 🎮 Genre-Based Game Finder

A React web application where users can select multiple genres and discover games that match **all selected genres**. The project integrates with the [RAWG.io API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) to fetch real game data and demonstrates interactive UI building, API integration, and state management in React.

## 🌟 Why I Built This
This project was created to practice **modern frontend development skills** while working with a real-world API. It showcases my ability to:
- Build reusable React components.
- Manage shared state across components.
- Use conditional rendering for different UI states.
- Apply dynamic styling (hover effects, selected states).
- Handle asynchronous API calls and edge cases.
- Organize a codebase for scalability.
